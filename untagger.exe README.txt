**untagger.exe**
Description:
    Untags all Tags in your level. Shouldn't affect gameplay unless you had triple nested Tags that don't get loaded by the game.
Warning:
    May break if you have nested Tags.
How to use:
    .1. Trust this code (Very important).
    .2. Save your level if you are in the editor (Make sure you can play it without errors).
    .3. Create a copy of your level for the unlikely event where your level breaks afterwards.
    .4. Put the untagger.exe into the folder of your specific level (**not** in the "tags" folder).
    .5. Run it. The Command Prompt should open for a brief moment.
    .6. Check the "tags" folder of your level. It should be empty.
    .7. Reopen your level in the editor.
   .(8. Report errors to me.)
